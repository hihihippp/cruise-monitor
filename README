=== What's this?

Cruise-monitor is, well, a monitor to CruiseControl.rb build status, via RSS feed. It uses
MacOS 'say' command for notifications.

It then turned out to be quite good to integrate with other build servers: CruiseControl.rb, 
CruiseControl.NET and Hudson are supported, plans are to support CruiseControl as well (see TODO).

=== How to use it

Cruise-monitor is a ruby script. It requires gem and rake.

First install required gems:
	sudo gem install httpclient nokogiri

Then, run all tests with:
	rake

Cruise-monitor is shipped with a sample script. Copy it to cruise_monitor.rb:
	cp script/cruise_monitor.rb.example script/cruise_monitor.rb

To configure, simply edit CRUISE_URL into script/cruise_monitor.rb.

Set script executable, with
	chmod +x ./script/cruise_monitor.rb

Try to run it:
	./script/cruise_monitor.rb

Finally, you can schedule a cron job (with crontab -e), like this:

	*/5 * * * * /$path_to_cruise_monitor/script/cruise_monitor.rb

where $path_to_cruise_monitor links to the folder you have copied Cruise-monitor into.

That's it. Have fun, and keep the build clean!
